# Eyedropper

Simple and convenient tool to identify the hex value of any color on the screen. Simply click on the icon:

Your mouse will become a crosshair. Click on any color you desire and both the color and the hex value will be displayed.

Should you select the color of your bar, you will not be able to see the icon (as the icon and the bar are the same color), but you will still be able to read the hex value
